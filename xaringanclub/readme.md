# Xaringan Club

> The First Rule of Xaringan Club is you don't talk about how much time you spend on silliness like this - Travis Gerke

A hex logo inspired by mashing up Fight Club with the Xaringan logo. 

Font is [Fight This](https://www.dafont.com/fight-this.font) which seems to be accurate to the movie's text styles.
The X looks like a lambda, so to correct it I rotated another X around by 180 degrees and overlayed it.
