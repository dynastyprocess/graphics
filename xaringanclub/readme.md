## Sharing (e.g. on Twitter)

This hex logo was created in response to [a tweet by Dr Silvia Canelon](https://twitter.com/spcanelon/status/1382063172530671617?s=20) and is absolutely welcome to be shared - especially for welcoming people to the Xaringan Club! You do not have to tag me while using the image, but please consider including alt-text wherever it's shared!

Suggested alt text: 

> Xaringan Club hex logo: a pink and black logo featuring a stylized eye and the words "Xaringan Club" emblazoned on a soap bar. Inspired by the Xaringan hex logo and the Fight Club soap logo. Logo originally created by Tan Ho https://github.com/dynastyprocess/graphics and is released under CC0.

## Design notes

A hex logo inspired by mashing up Fight Club's pink soap logo with the Xaringan hex logo. 

Font is [Fight This](https://www.dafont.com/fight-this.font) which seems to be accurate to the movie's text styles.
The X looks like a lambda, so to correct it I rotated another X around by 180 degrees and overlayed it.
