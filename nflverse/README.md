# nflverse logo

![nflverse.com logo](https://github.com/dynastyprocess/graphics/blob/main/nflverse/nflverse.png)

A logo for the new [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse) GitHub org, which centralises the main NFL R packages and data repositories together under one "roof". 

Inspo: a spiral galaxy spinning out from a central football, with hex-shaped planets and colourful stars - partially inspired by the current tidyverse logo's colour/design scheme.

Font: Jetbrains Mono
